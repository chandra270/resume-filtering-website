PROJECT



Title	                : Optimizing cloud Resources for delivering IPTV          service through virtualization.

       Team Size          : 2

       Environment      : ASP.NET,SQL SERVER



Description:

Virtualized cloud-based services can take advantage of statistical multiplexing across applications to yield significant cost savings. However, achieving similar savings with real-time services can be a challenge.

we seek to lower a provider’s costs for real-time IPTV services through a virtualized IPTV architecture and through intelligent time-shifting of selected services. Using Live TV and Video-on-Demand (VoD) as examples, we show that we can take advantage of the different deadlines associated with each service to effectively multiplex these services

This robot is used for rescue purpose in earthquake areas. In the proposed system the DTMF decoder, PIR

sensor, Ultrasonic sensor and the robot is interfaced with the PIC controller. The robot is navigated according to the commands given in the mobile. The DTMF decoder will decode the particular data and give it to the controller. According to the data the robot will move. The PIR sensor is used to check whether any human is present in the area. If any human detected then a message will be send to the monitoring GSM number. The ultrasonic sensor is used to stop colliding with obstacles. If any obstacle or human detected GPS value is fetch by controller and send through GSM



MINI PROJECT

DES IGN AND FABRIC ATION OF RED OBJEC T TRAC KING 2-AXIS ROBOT US ING MATLAB S OFTWARE

Object tracking can be done by identifying and tracking some specific feature of the moving object such as color that belongs to the moving object. Thus trajectories of moving object can be traced through this process over time. Object tracking using computer vision is a crucial component in achieving robotic surveillance.The main aim of the object tracking is to track the object based on the information obtained from video

sequences.In our project, we determine the region on interest (ROI) of the moving target which is followed adaptive color filter to extract the color information and thus the object is tracked. The  main contribution on  this paper is that the introduction on a color filtering method which  is  capable  of adaptively identifying  the most salient color feature that belongs to for moving object and using this color feature for tracking.

Project Profile 

Main Project   : M.E



REVERSIBLE DATA HIDING IN ENCRYPTED IMAGES



Team Size:   1

Period:   1 year

Skills:   Design, Programming in Matlab

Environment:   Matlab

Operating System:   Windows 2007

Current status:   Completed first phase of project



Description:  Internet has made it easier data transfer accurate and faster to the destination. At the same time it is may be easier to modify and misuse the valuable information through hacking. Reversible data hiding (RDH) in encrypted images maintains the excellent property that the original cover can be losslessly recovered after embedded data is extracted while protecting the image content’s confidentiality. In this  method by reserving room before encryption with a traditional RDH algorithm is used . Furthermore, this  method can achieve real reversibility, separate data extraction and greatly improvement on the quality of marked decrypted Images data extraction and image recovery are free of any error



Main Project   : B.TECH



Team Size:   4

Period:   3 months

Skills:   Design, Programming in VHDL, Simulation in Xilinx

Environment:   Xilinx

Operating System:   Windows 2007



Description: 

The HF radar receiver system used for ionospheric measurements, installed at VSSC, Trivandrum. The HF radar system used here works mainly on 18 MHz.. This signal is amplified to 50kW peak power in the transmitter and is fed to the antenna. This electromagnetic energy is radiated into space by antenna array. The backscattered signal from the irregularities are passed through a coherent receiver where the signal is phase detected using two reference signals having quadrature phase relationship. The in phase and quadrature phase outputs of the two phase detectors (sine and cosine channels) have all the information contained in the backscattered received signal. As a part of augmentation, the receiver system of the HF radar to a state-of-the-art Digital Receiver using FPGA technology is to be carried out.

Cheat Sheet

Maven





Options to make it faster



DB db = DBMaker

// all options works with files as well

.newMemoryDB();

// disable transactions make writes

// but you may lose data if store crashes

.transactionsDisable()

// memory mapped files are faster

// but does not work well on 32bit

.mmapFileEnable()

// writes done by background thread

// it has some overhead, so could be slower

.asyncWriteEnable()

// increase cache size if you have free heap

// default value is 32K

.cacheSize(1000000)

.make();





Other DBMaker options



// encrypt data with password

.encryptionEnable(“password”)

// use fast compression

.compressionEnable()

// enables CRC32 checksum

// to protect from data corruption

.checksumEnable()



Cache options



// It caches deserialized objects on heap.

// Default cache size is 32,000, increase it

.cacheSize(1000000)

// enable least-recently-used cache

.cacheLRUEnable()

// Unbounded soft-reference cache

// use with plenty of free heap

.cacheSoftRefEnable()// Hard ref, use if heap is larger then store

.cacheHardRefEnable()





Concurrent transactions



// By default there is single-global

// transaction per store.

// This enables proper transactions

// with full serializable isolation TxMaker txMaker = DBMaker

.newFileDB(file)

.makeTxMaker();



// open two transactions, with single map

// both can only see their own changes DB tx1 = txMaker.makeTx();

Map map1 = tx1.getTreeMap(""map""); DB tx2 = txMaker.makeTx();

Map map2 = tx2.getTreeMap(""map"");



//commit and close tx1.commit() tx2.commit() txMaker.close()





Snapshots



// lighter way to get consistent data view DB db = DBMaker

.newFileDB(file)

.snapshotEnable()

.make()

Map map = db.getHashMap(“map”); map.put(1,2);

DB snap = db.snapshot();



Map mapOld = snap.getHashMap(“map”); map.put(3,4); //mapOld still has only 1,2 snap.close(); //release resources





// Third way to ensure consistency is

// Compare and Swap operation. MapDB

// has ConcurrentMap and atomic variables.



<dependency>

<artifactId>mapdb</artifactId>

<version>[version]</version>

</dependency>









Map stored in file







import org.mapdb.*;





//open (or create) database

File file = new File(“dbFileName”); DB db = DBMaker

.newFileDB(file)

.make();





//use map

Map map = db.getHashMap(“mapName”); map.put(“aa”,”bb”);





//commit and close database db.commit();

db.close();









In-memory off-heap Map







// same as above except different method DB db = DBMaker

.newMemoryDirectDB();

.make();









In-memory off-heap Queue







// same as above except different method DB db = DBMaker

.newMemoryDirectDB();

.make();

Queue q = db.getQueue(“q”);













Maps and Sets





Configuring maps



// create map optimized for large values Map<String,String> m =

db.createTreeMap(“treeMap”);



//serializers are critical for performance

.keySerializer(BTreeKeySerializer.STRING)

// compress large ASCII string values

.valueSerializer(

new Serializer.CompressionWrapper( Serializer.STRING_ASCII))

// and store values outside of BTree nodes

.valuesOutsideNodesEnable()

// enable size counter

.counterEnable()

// make BTree nodes larger

.nodeSize(120)

// and finally create map

.makeOrGet();





Secondary indexes



// create secondary value (1:1 relation)

// secondary map gets auto updated Map<ID, Person> persons

Map<ID, Branch> branches Bind.secondaryValue(persons,branches,

(person)-> person.getBranch()));



// create secondary key (index) for age(N:1) SortedSet<Fun.Tuple2<Age,ID>> ages Bind.secondaryKey(persons, ages,

(person)-> person.getAge());



// get all persons of age 32 for(ID id: Fun.filter(ages, 32)){

Person p = persons.get(id)

}





HTreeMap as a cache



// Entries are removed if map is too large



// Off-heap map with max size 16GB

Map cache = DBMaker

.newCacheDirect(16)



// On-disk cache in temp folder

// with max size 128GB or 1M entries



DB db = DBMaker

.newTempFileDB()

.transactionDisable()

.closeOnJvmShutdown()

.deleteFilesAfterClose()

.make() Map cache = db

.createHashMap(""cache"")

.expireStoreSize(128) // GB

.expireMaxSize(1000000)

.make()





Data Pump for faster import



// Data Pump creates TreeMap and TreeSet

// in streaming fashion. Import time is linear

// to number of entries.

Iterator iter = … iterate over keys.. Map<K,V> m = db.createTreeMap(""map"")

.pumpSource(iter, (key)-> key.getValue())

.pumpIgnoreDuplicates()

.pumpPresort(1000000)

.make()



// Shows how to get all available collections DB db = DBMaker

.newMemoryDirectDB();

.make();





// BTreeMap is good for small sorted keys ConcurrentNavigableMap treeMap =

db.getTreeMap(“treeMap”);





// HashMap (aka HTreeMap) is good for

// larger keys and as a cache ConcurrentMap hashMap =

db.getHashMap(“hashMap”);





// there is also TreeSet and HashSet

SortedSet treeSet = db.getTreeSet(“ts”); Set hashSet = db.getHashSet(“hashSet”);







Queues







// first-in-first-out queue

BlockingQueue fifo = db.getQueue(“fifo”);





// last-in-first-out queue (stack) BlockingQueue lifo = db.getStack(“lifo”);





// circular queue with limited size BlockingQueue c =

db.getCircularQueue(“circular”);







Atomic records







// atomically updated records stored in DB

// Useful for example for sequential IDs.

// there is Long, Integer, String

// and general atomic variable

Atomic.Long q =db.getAtomicLong(“long”); q.set(1999);

long id = q.incremendAndGet();",MapDB Cheat Sheet wwwmapdborg Maven Options make fast db db DBMaker option work file well newMemoryDB disable transaction make write lose data store crash

Project



“Title: Location Variation Control in Steering Column Assembly by Jig Improvement.

          Our Project work is done in Hyundai Mobis Private India limited.

Description: we designed a new jig for the steering column, In old jig it looks with various drawbacks in its designs such as ignition lock issue, shaking condition, clamp deflection, column pipe damage, movement of steering column, lack of supporting clamp, defect in motor supporting stage and attachment for steering column etc., In order to overcome all those drawbacks, we all came up with an idea in concluding all these problems. It provided a rigid and clamping type jig to avoid ignition lock gap issue.

Project1:          Advancement in commercial vehicles 

DESCRIPTION: 

           In this project we studied that our country is consuming 3.4 million barrels per day (bbl/d) means 70.08 millions of barrels annually in which   3% fuel is consume by HCV. It has been found currently only 10% HCV are well designed for Aerodynamic drags rest are running their vehicles without bothering on their fuel economy improvement on the basis of technical changes.

Project2:     Automatic car lifting jack

DESCRIPTION: 

                   The automatic car jack basically works on the conservation of the motion .The automatic car jack converts the rotary motion into the translatory motion. The automatic car jack is operated by turning the lead screw with the motor and chain & gear mechanism which eliminates the requirement of the human labor to rotate the lead screw. The motor is driven by the 12V battery which is generally the battery of car itself.

ACADEMIC PROJECT

	PARTIAL REPLACE OF FINE AGGREGATE IN CONCRETE MIX DESIGN

	Description: This paper reports on an experimental program to investigate the effect of using copper slag as a replacement of fine aggregate on the strength properties. Copper slag is the waste material of matte smelting and refining of copper such that each ton of copper generates approximately 2.5 tons of copper slag. Copper slag is one of the materials that is considered as a waste which could have a promising future in construction Industry as partial or full substitute of aggregates. For this research work, M25 grade concrete was used and tests were conducted for various proportions of copper slag replacement with sand of 0 to 100% in concrete. The obtained results were compared with those of control concrete made with ordinary Portland cement and sand.

ACADEMIC PROJECTS 



“3-Dimensional analysis of chevron notched bar specimen by using computational fracture mechanics”

Designed the chevron notched specimen of crack length to width ratios (a/w) ranging from 0.3 to 0.7, in ANSYS.

Simulated the loading process in ANSYS, and evaluated the stress intensity factor for the chevron notched specimen of different a/w ratios.

Plotted graphs and compared the results with experimental solutions from the literature.



“Design and fabrication of energy generator from speed breakers”

The mechanism consists of a vertical piston spring arrangement, which impinges pressurized fluid on the prime mover, and this rotates the shaft connected to the motor to generate electrical energy.

The assembly was designed on Solid Works and later fabricated using select materials.

Tests were conducted to measure the rpm of the shaft and the voltage generated. By determining the input mechanical energy and the output electrical energy, the efficiency was calculated.
