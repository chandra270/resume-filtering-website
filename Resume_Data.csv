PROJECT



Title	                : Optimizing cloud Resources for delivering IPTV          service through virtualization.

       Team Size          : 2

       Environment      : ASP.NET,SQL SERVER



Description:

Virtualized cloud-based services can take advantage of statistical multiplexing across applications to yield significant cost savings. However, achieving similar savings with real-time services can be a challenge.

we seek to lower a providers costs for real-time IPTV services through a virtualized IPTV architecture and through intelligent time-shifting of selected services. Using Live TV and Video-on-Demand (VoD) as examples, we show that we can take advantage of the different deadlines associated with each service to effectively multiplex these services

This robot is used for rescue purpose in earthquake areas. In the proposed system the DTMF decoder, PIR

sensor, Ultrasonic sensor and the robot is interfaced with the PIC controller. The robot is navigated according to the commands given in the mobile. The DTMF decoder will decode the particular data and give it to the controller. According to the data the robot will move. The PIR sensor is used to check whether any human is present in the area. If any human detected then a message will be send to the monitoring GSM number. The ultrasonic sensor is used to stop colliding with obstacles. If any obstacle or human detected GPS value is fetch by controller and send through GSM



MINI PROJECT

DES IGN AND FABRIC ATION OF RED OBJEC T TRAC KING 2-AXIS ROBOT US ING MATLAB S OFTWARE

Object tracking can be done by identifying and tracking some specific feature of the moving object such as color that belongs to the moving object. Thus trajectories of moving object can be traced through this process over time. Object tracking using computer vision is a crucial component in achieving robotic surveillance.The main aim of the object tracking is to track the object based on the information obtained from video

sequences.In our project, we determine the region on interest (ROI) of the moving target which is followed adaptive color filter to extract the color information and thus the object is tracked. The  main contribution on  this paper is that the introduction on a color filtering method which  is  capable  of adaptively identifying  the most salient color feature that belongs to for moving object and using this color feature for tracking.

Project Profile 

Main Project   : M.E



REVERSIBLE DATA HIDING IN ENCRYPTED IMAGES



Team Size:   1

Period:   1 year

Skills:   Design, Programming in Matlab

Environment:   Matlab

Operating System:   Windows 2007

Current status:   Completed first phase of project



Description:  Internet has made it easier data transfer accurate and faster to the destination. At the same time it is may be easier to modify and misuse the valuable information through hacking. Reversible data hiding (RDH) in encrypted images maintains the excellent property that the original cover can be losslessly recovered after embedded data is extracted while protecting the image contents confidentiality. In this  method by reserving room before encryption with a traditional RDH algorithm is used . Furthermore, this  method can achieve real reversibility, separate data extraction and greatly improvement on the quality of marked decrypted Images data extraction and image recovery are free of any error



Main Project   : B.TECH



Team Size:   4

Period:   3 months

Skills:   Design, Programming in VHDL, Simulation in Xilinx

Environment:   Xilinx

Operating System:   Windows 2007



Description: 

The HF radar receiver system used for ionospheric measurements, installed at VSSC, Trivandrum. The HF radar system used here works mainly on 18 MHz.. This signal is amplified to 50kW peak power in the transmitter and is fed to the antenna. This electromagnetic energy is radiated into space by antenna array. The backscattered signal from the irregularities are passed through a coherent receiver where the signal is phase detected using two reference signals having quadrature phase relationship. The in phase and quadrature phase outputs of the two phase detectors (sine and cosine channels) have all the information contained in the backscattered received signal. As a part of augmentation, the receiver system of the HF radar to a state-of-the-art Digital Receiver using FPGA technology is to be carried out.

ACADEMIC PROJECT

	PARTIAL REPLACE OF FINE AGGREGATE IN CONCRETE MIX DESIGN

	Description: This paper reports on an experimental program to investigate the effect of using copper slag as a replacement of fine aggregate on the strength properties. Copper slag is the waste material of matte smelting and refining of copper such that each ton of copper generates approximately 2.5 tons of copper slag. Copper slag is one of the materials that is considered as a waste which could have a promising future in construction Industry as partial or full substitute of aggregates. For this research work, M25 grade concrete was used and tests were conducted for various proportions of copper slag replacement with sand of 0 to 100% in concrete. The obtained results were compared with those of control concrete made with ordinary Portland cement and sand.

ACADEMIC PROJECTS 



3-Dimensional analysis of chevron notched bar specimen by using computational fracture mechanics

Designed the chevron notched specimen of crack length to width ratios (a/w) ranging from 0.3 to 0.7, in ANSYS.

Simulated the loading process in ANSYS, and evaluated the stress intensity factor for the chevron notched specimen of different a/w ratios.

Plotted graphs and compared the results with experimental solutions from the literature.



Design and fabrication of energy generator from speed breakers

The mechanism consists of a vertical piston spring arrangement, which impinges pressurized fluid on the prime mover, and this rotates the shaft connected to the motor to generate electrical energy.

The assembly was designed on Solid Works and later fabricated using select materials.

Tests were conducted to measure the rpm of the shaft and the voltage generated. By determining the input mechanical energy and the output electrical energy, the efficiency was calculated.
